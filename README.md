# üö≤ AdventureWorks Sales Analysis (SQL + Python + Excel)

This project delivers a complete data workflow for cleaning, analyzing, and reporting on the AdventureWorks dataset using **MySQL**, **Python**, and **Excel**. It mirrors real-world BI tasks like data validation, SQL-based transformations, and visual reporting preparation.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

To simulate a business-focused data analysis pipeline that:
- Identifies and cleans raw sales data
- Prepares analysis-ready tables using SQL and Python
- Generates KPIs and reusable SQL views
- Exports data for Excel-based reporting and visualization

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** ‚Äî cleaning, joining, and view creation
- **Python (Pandas, OpenPyXL)** ‚Äî data preprocessing, CSV manipulation, Excel exports
- **Excel** ‚Äî for pivot charts and dashboard-style insights

## üìå Key Notes

- Invalid foreign keys (`-1`) replaced with dummy entries: `CustomerKey = 10999`, `ResellerKey = 0`
- Dates originally in `YYYYMMDD` int format converted to SQL `DATE`
- Final analysis is portable via `.csv` or `.xlsx` and ready for BI or Excel dashboards
